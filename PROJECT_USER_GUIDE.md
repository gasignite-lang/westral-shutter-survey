## 2. The Survey Workflow

### Step 1: Project Setup
*   **Client Details**: Enter the Name, Address, and Reference Number.
*   **Product Selection**: Choose "Woodlore", "Woodlore Plus", etc.
*   **Global Defaults**: Set the **Frame** and **Color** here. All new rooms will automatically copy these settings (saving you time!).
*   **AI Data Extraction**: Tap the **Scan/Camera** icon to instantly load data from an order form.
    *   **What it pulls**: Client Name, Address, Contact, Reference #, Product, Color, Blade, Mounting, and all Room measurements from the table.
    *   **Verification (Blue-to-Black)**: Scanned data appears in **BLUE**.
        *   **Tap once**: Verifies the data (turns it **BLACK**) and blocks the keyboard/dropdown so you can see the change.
        *   **Tap twice**: Opens the keyboard or dropdown for manual editing.
        *   *Why?* This ensures you double-check AI-extracted data before it becomes "final".
    *   **Tip: Offline Scanning**: The AI Scan requires internet. If you have no signal, take a photo of the form with your normal iPad camera app. Later, when you have WiFi, use the **"Photo Library"** option to scan that photo.

### Step 2: Surveying Rooms
*   **Add Room**: Tap the `+` icon in the Room Tabs bar.
*   **Measurements**: Enter W x H x D.
    *   **Over-Specification (Red Text)**: If you enter a width or height that exceeds the product's maximum (e.g., Woodlore single panel max), the text will turn **RED**.
*   **Dynamic Buttons & Diagram**:
    *   **Frame Edges**: Tap the diagram edges (Top, Left, Right, Bottom) to cycle through:
        *   **YES (Green)**: Standard frame.
        *   **CILL (Yellow)**: Sill cut-out.
        *   **NO (Red)**: Frame removed.
    *   **T-Post / Corner Color**: Tap the green **"T-Post"** button to toggle between specialized post types.
    *   **Photo Area**: Tap the center of the diagram to add a **Photo** of the window.
*   **Validation**: The app automatically checks your blade size vs. depth and will warn you if it won't fit.

### Step 3: Review & Sign
*   Go to the **Review** tab to see the "Office Spreadsheet".
*   Check all details are correct.
*   **Signatures (Consolidated)**:
    *   **Customer Signature**: Tap the top box under "Customer Signature" and have them sign.
    *   **Surveyor Signature**: Tap the bottom box under "Surveyor Signature" and sign yourself.
*   **Download CSV**:
    *   Tap the **"DOWNLOAD CSV"** button. This saves a spreadsheet file to your device.
*   **Submit**:
    *   Tap **"SUBMIT ORDER"**.
    *   This generates the email draft.
    *   **IMPORTANT**: Attach the downloaded CSV file to this email!
    *   The data is also saved to the "Archive" tab.

## 3. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need internet?**
**A: NO.** You can measure, photograph, and save the entire house in Airplane Mode. You only need internet at the very end to hit "Send" on the email (and for AI scanning).

**Q: What if I close the tab?**
**A:** The app saves your data automatically as you type. If you accidentally close Safari, just open the file again—your current job should still be there.

**Q: How do i update the app?**
**A:** When the office sends a new version (e.g., `WestralSurvey_v2.html`), just delete the old file from your "Files" app and save the new one.

**Q: The frame text is hard to read.**
**A:** This has been fixed! The "YES/NO" labels now have a shadow to make them pop against white backgrounds.
